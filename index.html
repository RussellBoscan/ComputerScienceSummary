                                In this project <s>we developed</s>, we tried to develop a puzzle-simulation, text-based game with cybersecurity as the main topic, and it ended up as a good example for why planning is key when working as a team. We did use messaging platforms to communicate some features that the game could have, if it would have a plot and what could it be about or how, since it was a level based game, it would be the levels designed, but we weren't able to implement those features into the game. We didn't take into account the limited amount of time we had when planning the game.

                                The main idea of the game was based on an existing video game called Papers, Please. You would be in charge of reviewing all the emails of the company to see if they were a scam or they were actual emails from other companies your company worked with, you would have a menu on the left side of the screen to see which companies your company had work with before, the contracts and the time they were in force, their workers and their emails. You would receive the emails, and according to what the email could say and the information you had, decide if to send it to the worker in your company it was supposed to go to, or to mark it as fake or scam.

                                Our website was intended as a convenient platform for small manga creators where they could share their digital manga and comics to a global audience. We used the design cycle. Research and analysis of existing solutions, like other platforms that sell comics and manga, what resources we would need in order to reach our goal, like servers to store users data, such as their accounts in our platform, the looks of the brand, and our potential customers and their needs. We developed our ideas, like the business model and how the website should look like. Then we started developing our solution.

                                Something I learned thanks to this project is how to respond to feedback. While designing the website, I often asked my teammate Miguel Quinteros for his thoughts. He gave me many ideas for the design, such as including the latest comics or manga releases at the beginning of the website, and he also provided feedback when we were designing the logo.

                                In this project we used collaborative tools, strategies, and the engineering design process to design, develop, test and improve a Rube Goldberg Machine. Our team was made out of 6 people: Miguel, Dre'shun, Cesar, Dion, Jerome, and myself, Russell.
                            </p>

                            Through this project I learned the following standards:
                        </h2>
                        <ul>

                                I will use collaborative tools, methods and strategies to design, develop and update <s>computational</s> artifacts.

                            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                                In this project, we used collaborative tools such as Google Docs and Drive, which allowed us to share the project and work together on the same document simultaneously, even with different schedules.
                                <br><br>
                                We used strategies like recording our daily progress for our peers to leave comments, which we later used to improve the project.
                                <br><br>
                                Another strategy we implemented was maintaining a table in the document to record our daily tasks and leave comments on areas where we needed help, allowing our teammates to address these issues and improve the project.
                            </p>

                                I will test and troubleshoot so that my creation produces reasonable results.

                            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                                During this project, we made a significant number of tests on our prototype, aiming for a result close to our initial concept. When the tests didn't meet the expected results, we worked to improve the prototype until we achieved a solid final result.

                                We had to test each step of the Rube Goldberg machine to ensure it connected correctly with the next step. Although not everything ended up exactly as in our first draft, the final result met our expectations.

                        <ul>

                                I will create comments to communicate to other developers and ensure documentation of the process.

                                Through this project, I also learned how important communication is. We had to leave precise comments for other developers to ensure the current state of the project was easy to understand and properly documented.

                                We included a section in our planning document where we posted videos of the current state of the Rube Goldberg machine. This allowed our teammates to easily understand how to set up the machine and identify the next step.

            <h1 class="textFormat-kode-mono glowText">Final Reflection</h1>
            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                <span class="glowText">In this class, I have learned</span> about the importance of the tools and strategies we use when working as a team. Communication and feedback are key to improving the ongoing project. 
            </p>
            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
               <span class="glowText">I also learned about</span> the design cycle and how important it is to research current solutions to a given problem; to design a detailed plan before starting to create prototypes of our solution, as well as planning the testing methods of the solution; to make documentation for the maintenance and improvement of the project; and how detailed this documentation needs to be for other developers to continue the project easily.
            </p>
            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                <span class="glowText">I have learned that I work</span> better <span class="glowText">with others</span> one-on-one rather than in a larger group, but I know there's a certain amount of work that can be done by two people at the same time.
            </p>    
            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                <span class="glowText">I learned that when something fails, I</span> test and try to improve on it.
            </p>    
            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                <span class="glowText">I learned that I respond to feedback</span> depending on the situation. If I like it and it seems that it could work, I implement it. If I don't like it but it seems that it could work, I still implement it. If I like it but it doesn't seem like it's going to work, I try to improve on it. If I don't like it and it doesn't seem like it's going to work, I work with the other person to come up with a different solution.
            </p>    
            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                <span class="glowText">I learned that I make revisions by</span> analyzing whether an idea seems good to me, and if I do not understand how it would be implemented, I ask for further explanation.
            </p>    
            <p class="textFormat-kode-mono">
                <span class="glowText">I also learned that I</span> tend to <span class="glowText">overthink</span> solutions that can be made <span class="glowText">simple</span>. I know that I tend to leave things halfway when I get stuck with a problem or run out of ideas. This is something I am constantly trying to improve about myself.
